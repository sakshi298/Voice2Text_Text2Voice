# Voice2Text_Text2Voice
This Streamlit app allows you to record your voice, transcribe it to text, and also convert text to speech â€” all in one place
Features
ðŸŽ¤ Voice to Text (Speech Recognition)

Uses the audio_recorder_streamlit component to capture audio directly from the browserâ€™s microphone.

Saves the recorded sound to a temporary .wav file.

Uses Pythonâ€™s SpeechRecognition library with Google Speech Recognition API to transcribe the speech into text.

Displays the transcribed text to the user.

Removes the temporary audio file after processing.

ðŸ’¬ Text to Voice (Speech Synthesis)

Accepts user input as text via a text area.

Uses gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to synthesize speech from the entered text.

Saves the generated speech as a temporary .mp3 file.

Plays back the generated audio in the browser.

Warns the user if they try to convert without entering text.

Integration Flow

The user can record a voice clip, see its transcription, then enter text (or reuse the transcribed text) to generate audio output.

All audio processing and playback happens locally in the browser session â€” no external UI file is needed if running as a single Streamlit script.
